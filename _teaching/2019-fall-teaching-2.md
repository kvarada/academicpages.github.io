An introduction to supervised machine learning, with a focus on classification. Covers common machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines, naive Bayes) and basic machine learning concepts such as generalization error and overfitting.

## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to:
- Describe supervised learning and identify what kind of tasks it is suitable for.
- Explain common machine learning concepts such as classification and regression, training and testing, overfitting, parameters and hyperparameters.
- Identify when and why to apply data pre-processing techniques such as scaling and one hot encoding.
- Describe at a high level how common machine learning algorithms work, including decision trees, kNN, naive Bayes, support vector machines, and random forests.
- Use Python and the scikit-learn package to develop a machine learning model using the above algorithms.
