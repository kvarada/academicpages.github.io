How to evaluate and select features and models. Cross-validation, evaluation metrics, feature engineering, the role of regularization. Automated hyperparameter optimization.

## Learning outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to

- build, debug, appropriately evaluate, and refine supervised machine learning models
- reason to some extent the choice of a machine learning model
- explain different feature selection methods and carry out feature selection
- describe at a high level what feature engineering is
- explain L1- and L2-regularization
