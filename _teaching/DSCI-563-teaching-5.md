This course is about identifying underlying structure in data. We will talk about clustering, dimensionality reduction, word embeddings, and recommendation systems.

### Course Learning Outcomes    

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to
- Explain the unsupervised paradigm.
- Explain the intuition behind clustering and use appropriate clustering algorithms for applications such as customer segmentation and document clustering.
- Interpret the results obtained after applying clustering.
- Explain the intuition behind dimensionality reduction and use such algorithms for applications such as anomaly detection.
- Explain the intuition of word2vec model to create word embeddings.
- Train your own word embeddings and use pre-trained word embeddings.
- Build word2vec style recommender system.
- Explain and build recommender systems, specifically using collaborative filtering approaches.
