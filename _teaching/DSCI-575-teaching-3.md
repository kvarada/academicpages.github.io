Advanced machine learning methods in the context of natural language processing (NLP) applications. Word embeddings, Markov chains, hidden Markov models, topic modeling, recurrent neural networks.

### Course Learning Outcomes    

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to
- Explain and use word embeddings for word meaning representation. 
- Train your own word embedding and use pre-trained word embeddings. 
- Specify a Markov chain and carry out generation and inference with them. 
- Explain the general idea of stationary distribution in Markov chains.
- Explain hidden Markov models and carry out decoding with them. 
- Explain Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach to topic modeling and carry out topic modeling on text data. 
- Explain Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and use them for classification, generation, and image captioning.
