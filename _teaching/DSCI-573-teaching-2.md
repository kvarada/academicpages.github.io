This course is about evaluating and selecting features and models. It covers the following topics: evaluation metrics, feature engineering, feature selection, the role of regularization, loss functions, and feature importances.

### Course Learning Outcomes    

By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to

- build, debug, appropriately evaluate, and refine supervised machine learning models
- reason to some extent the choice of a machine learning model
- explain different feature selection methods and carry out feature selection
- broadly describe and carry out feature engineering
- explain and carry out L1- and L2-regularization
