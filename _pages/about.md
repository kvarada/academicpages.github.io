My name is Varada Kolhatkar, which can be written as [ʋəɾəda kɔːlɦəʈkər] in the [International Phonetic Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) system. Varada is a Sanskrit name, which means the one who gives blessings.

I am a computational linguist, which means that I develop computational models to understand linguistic phenomena. I have recently started a teaching and research position at [UBC Master of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) program.
