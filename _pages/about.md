My name is Varada Kolhatkar ([IPA:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) [ʋəɾəda kɔːlɦəʈkər]). (If you are curious, Varada is a Sanskrit name, which means the one who grants your wishes.)  

My background is in computer science and my areas of expertise are natural language processing, computational linguistics, and applied machine learning. I received my Ph.D. in computational linguistics from the [Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/compling/). I have worked in industry as well as in academia in different countries, including Canada, the United States, Germany, and India. Since October 2018, I have been part of the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, where I teach Data Science and Computer Science. I started as a teaching postdoc with the [Master of Data Science program](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/why-ubc/leadership). Now my official job title is Assistant Professor of Teaching in the Department of Computer Science.
