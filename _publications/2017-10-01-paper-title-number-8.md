We examine the extent to which we are able to automatically identify constructive online comments. We build several classifiers
using New York Times Picks as positive examples and non-constructive thread comments from the Yahoo News Annotated
Comments Corpus as negative examples of constructive online comments. We evaluate these classifiers on a crowd-annotated
corpus containing 1,121 comments. Our best classifier achieves a top
F1 score of 0.84.
