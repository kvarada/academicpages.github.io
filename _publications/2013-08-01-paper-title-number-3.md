Anaphoric shell nouns such as this issue and this fact conceptually encapsulate complex pieces of information (Schmid, 2000). We examine the feasibility of annotating such anaphoric nouns using crowdsourcing.
In particular, we present our methodology for reliably annotating antecedents of such anaphoric nouns and the challenges we faced in doing so. We also evaluated the quality of crowd annotation using experts. The results suggest that most of the crowd annotations were good enough to use as training data for resolving such anaphoric nouns.
