WordNet::SenseRelate::AllWords is a freely available open source Perl package that assigns a sense to every content word (known to WordNet) in a text. It finds the sense of each word that is most related to the senses of surrounding words, based on measures found in WordNet::Similarity. This method is shown to be competitive with results from recent evaluations including SENSEVAL-2 and SENSEVAL-3.
