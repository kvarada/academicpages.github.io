We annotate and resolve a particular case of abstract anaphora, namely, _this-issue_ anaphora. We propose a candidate ranking model for _this-issue_ anaphora resolution that explores different issue specific and general abstract-anaphora features. The model is not restricted to nominal or verbal antecedents; rather, it is able to identify antecedents that are arbitrary spans of text. Our results show that (a) the model outperforms the strong adjacent-sentence baseline; (b) general abstract-anaphora features, as distinguished from _issue_-specific features, play a crucial role in this-issue anaphora resolution, suggesting that our approach can be generalized for other NPs such as _this problem_ and _this debate_; and (c) it is possible to reduce the search space in order to improve performance.
